# navigation_codelab

A new Flutter project.

!! How To Use my App !!

First, run the application that you have created,

next, you will go to the first screen, in the first screen there is a button that will go to the second screen,

click that button and you will be directed to the second screen,

in the second screen, there are 2 buttons, namely the button in the center and in the upper left corner (next to the text "second screen")

in general, applications usually use the back button in the upper left corner, but you can also use the button in the center to return to the first screen

after you press one of the buttons (the one in the upper left corner or in the center of the screen), you will be directed to the first screen.
